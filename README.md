# Technical Assignment: PHP Developer Role
## Objective:
Assess the developer's abilities in PHP, HTML, CSS, and working with RESTful APIs by creating a mini application that interacts with Spotify's API to search for artists by name.

## Assignment Overview:
You are required to create a mini web application using PHP, HTML, CSS, and the Spotify API.
The application should allow users to search for artists by name and display relevant information about the artists.

## Requirements:
### Spotify API Integration:

Register a new application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get your Client ID and Client Secret.
Use the Spotify Web API to search for artists by name.
### Documentation: [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/)

## Backend (PHP):
Create a PHP script to handle API requests to Spotify.
The script should accept a search query (artist's name) and fetch data from the Spotify API.
Parse and format the API response to extract relevant artist information (e.g., name, genres, popularity, image).

## Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
Create a simple, responsive HTML page with a search form.
Style the page using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Use JavaScript (optional) to handle the form submission and display the results dynamically without reloading the page.
Functionality:

The search form should allow users to input an artist's name and submit the search.
Upon submission, display a list of matching artists with the following information:
Artist's name
Genres
Popularity
Image (if available)
Include error handling for cases where no artists are found or an error occurs during the API request.

Bonus Points:
- Implement an authentication mechanism (username & password).
- Implement pagination if the search results exceed a certain number.
- Add a feature to display the top tracks of each artist.
- Use a front-end framework/library (e.g., Vue.js, React) to enhance the user experience.

## Deliverables:
